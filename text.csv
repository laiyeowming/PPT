"TSMC, which holds a 50% share of the world's chip foundry business, supplies computer chips to Huawei and American tech giants such as Google, Qualcomm and Intel.
The Taiwanese company also supplies high-performance chips for U.S. military suppliers such as Xilinx, which in turn makes components for American F-35 fighter jets and satellites.
TSMC, as a major U.S. and Chinese chip supplier, has often found itself in the middle of the technology standoff as a result.
In addition to the F-35 jets, TSMC makes U.S. Defense Department-approved ""military grade"" chips that may be used by some of its other American clients for classified military purposes.
The U.S. accounts for 60% of TSMC's sales, but the company operates only its subsidiary WaferTech there, producing chips for mature technologies"
"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), one of the world’s top contract chipmakers, is under mounting pressure from the Trump administration to make chips in the United States, sources told the Nikkei Asian Review.
“The U.S. government wants chips that go into military projects to be built on American soil,” a senior Taiwanese government official told The Nikkei.
The United States has made it a priority to avoid using Chinese technology and surveillance to manufacture high-security components, such as memory chips, to prevent any possible Chinese interference.
Officials from the United States Department of Defense earlier contacted TSMC’s U.S. customers to check on the security implications of overseas chip manufacturing.
TSMC, at the time, assured their U.S. clients that the company makes semiconductor chips in compliance with the U.S. government’s security mandates"
"""Whatever export controls are coming up we think 5G momentum will continue and the interruption will be very short term,"" Mark Liu, Chairman of TSMC, told investors and reporters in Taipei.
TSMC forecast that the foundry industry would grow 17% this year, and that it would outperform that by several percentage points.
To meet the forecast growth in demand, TSMC raised its planned capital spending to a record $15-16 billion for 2020, versus $14.9 billion last year.
For 2019, TSMC sales reached a record NT$1.06 trillion, up 3.7% on year, but net income dropped 1.6% to NT$345.26 billion due to a sharp slowdown in the first half of 2019.
TSMC serves as a barometer of global electronics demand as it supplies a wide range of chip developers worldwide, including Apple, Huawei Technologies, Qualcomm, Google, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Sony, and Advanced Micro Devices"
"WASHINGTON — Among the corporate titans recognized last week by President Trump during a White House signing ceremony for his China trade deal was Sanjay Mehrotra, the chief executive of Micron Technology, whose Idaho semiconductor company is at the heart of Mr. Trump’s trade war.
Micron, which makes memory chips for computers and smartphones, is precisely the kind of advanced technology company that the Trump administration views as crucial to maintaining a competitive edge over China.
But that two-year conflagration may wind up being more damaging to American technology companies.
The initial trade deal announced last week should make operating in China easier for companies like Micron.
The deal contains provisions meant to protect American technology and trade secrets and allow companies to challenge China on accusations of theft, including older cases like Micron’s that precede the agreement"
"CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AKHAN Semiconductor, a technology company specializing in the fabrication and application of lab-grown, electronic-grade diamonds, announced today that it has been issued a patent by the United States Patent Office (USPTO).

"Over the following months, U.S officials examined whether they could block the sale outright and held at least four rounds of talks with Dutch officials, three sources told Reuters.
With no way to block the sale directly, the Trump administration pressed its Dutch ally to consider the security issues.
Six weeks later, during his visit to the White House, Rutte was given a copy of the intelligence report.
Reuters could not determine whether U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned the ASML deal to Rutte during the White House meeting.
With or without the EUV license, ASML expects its Chinese sales to increase in 2020 as it continues to ship earlier-generation equipment"

"For many policymakers in Beijing, the inevitable trend is towards more decoupling of the two countries’ tech supply chains.
For all the accusations China has faced about stealing other countries’ technology, Beijing is now embracing international open-source, or free to use, collaborations.
But within China, these justifications are seen as excuses for a broader agenda: preventing the rise of China as a challenger to the US as a tech superpower.
The officials say their concern is not limited to a few tech companies, but that all Chinese companies could be seen as threats because they are potentially subject to the ruling Communist party’s control.
The ministry of industry and information technology, China’s tech industry regulator, has recently encouraged Microsoft’s GitHub, the world’s biggest code-sharing platform and host of open-source collaborations, to expand in China"

"Scrutiny could extend to MIC 2025, BRI-affiliated projectsBroadly speaking, the US national security community, particularly the Department of Defense (DoD), sees the United States as being engaged in “great power” competition with China over emerging technologies.
Meanwhile, US military leaders have expressed concern about the alleged role US companies play in willingly transferring technology to the Chinese military.
In response, the US government has been actively studying additional measures to prevent US companies from transferring dual-use technology to CMI-affiliated companies.
National security concerns—perceived and real—will define the US-China relationship for the foreseeable future, even as “phase one” and subsequent rounds of trade agreements may yield new market openings in China.
How well US companies manage the tension between opportunity and risk in the era of great power competition will largely depend on the extent to which they can address problems before they occur"

"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — South Korea can hardly compete with Taiwan in semiconductor manufacturing despite the ambitious move by Samsung Electronics to put a 3-nanometer semiconductor node into commercial production, said Taiwan’s top tech official.
Taiwan’s semiconductor industry had an annual output valued at NT$2.6 trillion (US$867 billion) in 2019, said Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) Minister Chen Liang-gee (陳良基) at a news conference held on Monday (Jan. 20).
The output is expected to double to NT$5.2 trillion within a decade and even reach NT$6 trillion by 2030 according to an optimistic forecast, wrote UDN.
While Samsung is striving to stay ahead of the game through the advancement of chip-making technology with strong backing from the South Korean government, it is unlikely to beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest semiconductor foundry, Chen believes.
Taiwan’s semiconductor businesses thrive on cluster development and an “industry ecology,” as evidenced by the country's many science parks, Chen said"
